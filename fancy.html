      <h2>Some people may find this guide confusing to follow.</h2>
      <p class="br">I get it. If you are doing this stuff for the first time, you may be uncertain about what you are doing, despite the content laid out before you optimized to waste as little of your time and bandwidth as possible. If you are confused, ask the person who provided this guide to you for additional consultation and advice.</p>
      <p>Much confusion can be had by "Skimming" the contents of this guide. <i>Do not "Skim", "Scan" or otherwise half-read contents of this guide.</i></p>
      <p class="br"><span class="hl3">Every word has a purpose, and treating each word of this guide with equal respect and time will ensure you do not trip over yourself and break your console in the process.</span></p>
      <h2>It's okay to be afraid.</h2>
      <p class="br">If you are feeling uncertain about doing this, or uneasy about following certain steps, it is reasonable to feel fear and anxiety. You are performing actions which would invalidate whatever warranty Nintendo has extended to your device, in exchange for additional features enabled by use of third-party software. There is also a chance of being banned from Nintendo's servers for online play, but there are ways and means around that which are not in the scope of this guide and it is <i>very</i> unlikely the act of having custom firmware by itself would be cause for a ban. Don't cheat or otherwi se subvert game rules and you'll be fine.</p>
      <h2>Following these steps correctly, <i>you will not brick.</i></h2>
      <p class="br">Along with the uncertainty about future participation in online titles, people are concerned about <i>bricking</i>; the incapability of using your console because of a software or hardware fault. This shouldn't happen. Everything shown below is to be followed procedurally, and while there may be alternative steps shown for doing certain things, it is only for acquisition of files needed to modify your console; the act of doing it remains the same, no matter what, and has been performed on countless thousands of handhelds covered in this guide.</p>
      <h2>You may feel overwhelmed while reading this</h2>
      <p class="br">There is <i>a lot</i> of stuff here, which is why it is broken down in steps and sections. Take it one step at a time, from top-to-bottom. In an hour or two you will finish this, and you will succeed should you not deviate from any of the critical steps necessary for softmodding the console. <span class="hl3">If you feel pressed for time, <i><u>stop</u></i>:</span> Instead of rushing to finish this under a time limit, bookmark this page and read this later. Look for the blue seed and access said bookmark later to continue reading later.</p>
      <h2>"Oh my goodness, this is a lot of reading."</h2>
      <p>Yeah, I know it's pretty involved. Just <i>deal with it</i> and read. <span class="hl3">If you skipped to this immediately, <i><u>stop</u></i>: read all contents in this box from the beginning.</span> If you'd rather voice assistance or need to make sure you are doing everything correctly, feel free to initiate a video chat in Discord for sharing your display and use voice communications for enhanced assistance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info msg bdr br"><a href="https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp">For help with most Nintendo Homebrew things, there's a Discord guild for that.</a> This guide is not associated with them, but you can join there anyway for general inqueries.</div>
    <div class="info msg bdr br">If you are interested in free games and other topics Nintendo Homebrew may outright ban you for, ask whoever gave you this page about another guild more open to that kind of discussion. Otherwise, you'll be finished with this guide at section 5.</div>

      <div class="warn msg bdr br">This guide is intended for use with <i>completely stock</i> 3DS consoles using firmware 11.4 - 11.8. <span class="hl3">Following these instructions with an Arm9LoaderHax-modified console will brick the console.</span> <u>Don't even try.</u> Future firmware <i>may</i> not brick the console; if given an update <i>before modding</i>, don't accept until it is certain the software provided is functional for the latest firmware version.</div>
      <div class="info msg bdr br">Any reference to 3DS also applies for 2DS, meaning that regardless of model these instructions will apply.</div>
      <div class="good msg bdr">After completing these instructions, it is safe to update Boot9Strap, Luma3DS and the console firmware.</div>
      <div class="body end">
        <p>There are several guides about this particular method of custom firmware already on the Internet. If you want to see those, ask about them in Nintendo Homebrew. If you want a <i>better</i> interpretation of this method optimized for speed and limited handling of media, then read on. The reason this guide exists is because I grew tired of telling people the same turns of phrase which serve to do nothing more than waste time and confuse people who cannot keep up with what I am saying, and for me to link so people can follow along with the same series of instructions which haven't failed any persons I had assisted as of yet. As lots of people just want to <i>get it done</i>, if you find yourself in the same camp then this guide is for you.</p>

        <h3>You will need the following</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>USD3 (or regional equivalent) in your Nintendo eShop account.</li>
          <li>A stock 3DS or 2DS, old or new.</li>

        <h3>Does the 3DS' SD card lack space? Expand and read this.</h3>
      </a>
      <div class="nestins">
        <div class="info msg end">
          <p class="br">There are three ways to handle a lack of disk space on the SD card. Before that, a brief of how the 3DS handles a new card:</p>
          <p class="br">When the console senses there is no data of its own on the SD card, it will write a new <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> directory. This is important to understand, as its contents will later be used to modify your console. It also <i>immensely</i> simplifies things as when finding what is known as your ID0 for later use with seedminer, you only have one directory which can be it, thus there is no need to search for the DSiWare title you'll copy in later steps to confirm this information.</p>
          <p class="br">Understanding this, here are the three ways to handle an SD card which is near its maximum capacity;</p>
          <ul class="txtli br">
            <li class="br">
              <p><u>Do nothing</u></p>
              <p>This is a foolish thing to do if you are uncertain of the space required. You should have, as a <i>reasonable</i> minimum 1.4GB available. If you lack this space, see next item.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="br">
              <p><u>Move everything to other media</u></p>
              <p>Moving the entire <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> directory out of the SD card will certainly yield much more disk space for modding, depending on how heavily you relied upon the woefully-undersized SD card which comes with most consoles out of the box. After you are finished performing steps in the following sections of this guide, <i>including the creation of a system memory backup</i> then you can move the transferred <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> directory to your SD card and merge all contents, should there still be room. If you find yourself unable to, or are anticipating purchase of a larger SD card, see next item.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><u>Move everything to a larger (micro)SD card</u></p>
              <p class="br">Had you already followed the previous item's advice, it's simply a matter of transferring all contents from the original SD card into a new one. For larger cards, third-party Windows disk management tools or a Linux / BSD live session with GParted / KParted / Gnome disk utility can enable writing a FAT32 partition on media WIndows refuses to write it for, despite its 2TB maximum size. If you are anticipating upgrade to a "New" 3DS and are still on an "Old" model with the more accessible full-size SD card, upgrading to a higher-capacity microSD card will futureproof the contents therein, as you can follow these steps to hack your new console and still use most of what's on the SD card, except maybe CIA-installed utilities you will have to re-acquire from FBI's titleDB elsewhere on the Internet.</p>
              <p>In the rare case you could not move your transferred <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> directory, when migrating to a new SD card, move the contents of the previous SD card used to mod your console <i>first</i> before moving the transferred <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> directory. This will ensure previous system preferences are transferred, overwriting <i>newer</i> files which were created as a response of nothing being in the SD card.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="br">You may notice other directories, such as <code>DCIM</code>. This is just pictures and such. If there is a lot of content there, move that out of the SD card also. If you have an <code>MP3</code> directory or other directories with music in them for Nintendo 3DS Sound, those contents may interfere with the process of modding as that may also take a significant amount of disk space. Should there be more than the <code>Nintendo 3DS</code> directory you need to move, creating a new directory on a larger media before writing to represent the <i>present</i> contents of the 3DS' SD card before modding will make returning the full contents of the SD card into its original place much easier.</p>
          <p>With the above information, you should be able to handle the contents of the 3DS' SD card with confidence knowing you will lose nothing you wish to keep.</p>

              </ul>

            <li><i>If applicable</i>, copy files <code>x360ce.ini</code> and <code>xinput1_3.dll</code> where <code>InputReciredtionClient-Qt.exe</code> is.</li>
            <li>Rename <code>xinput1_3.dll</code> to <code>xinput1_4.exe</code>.
              <ul>
                <li>Alternatively, create a hardlink for <code>xinput1_3.dll</code> named <code>xinput1_4.dll</code> if the software resides on an NTFS partition.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Run <code>InputRedirectionClient-Qt.exe</code>. If successful, you should hear a tone to confirm x360ce is emulating XInput.</li>

          <li>Give Snickerstream the console's IP address. (It's the same one you give to Input Redirection Client.)
            <li>In the Preset section, specify <i>Best framerate</i> to test, initially.</li>
            <li>Choose to connect; If it worked, scale video with <code>[Up]</code> and <code>[Down]</code> on the keyboard.</li>
